A small console application written in c# for university admin staff and students.
To access the admin path, the user would have to enter the correct username and passord. If entered successfully they are able to see course, teacher and student details.
For students, there are able to see course and teacher details as well as checking their grades and the course requirements.


Improvements/ Further works
- To be able to read and write txt files (prehaps store student and teacher details here)
- Add error handling
- To add some unit tests
